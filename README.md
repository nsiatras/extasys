Extasys
=======


Asynchronous TCP/UDP socket library

Extasys is a fast, accurate and easy to use TCP/UDP socket library for Java. The power of this socket is the asynchronous data proccessing that offers.

If you are using sockets then Extasys is the proper tool for your work. It's been designed to take the hard job done and let you think only about the message exchange (the process).

#### Goals
* Provide fast and accurate TCP and UDP data transfer
* Asynchronous processing
* Less development time

#### Features
* Dedicated Thread Pool for each TCPServer, TCPClient, UDPServer and UDPClient
* Multiple listeners per server and multiple connectors per Client
* TCP message collector with character or string message splitter

## How to Use

**Fully functional examples on how to use Extasys can be found** [inside the repository](https://github.com/nsiatras/extasys/tree/master/Extasys%20for%20Java%20Examples).
