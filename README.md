Extasys - Asynchronous TCP/UDP socket library
=======

Extasys is a high performance, **asynchronous TCP/UDP socket library** originally made with Java. 

Its **multi-threaded and lightweight** nature makes it ideal for super fast data transfer even on systems with ARM architecture like smartphones and single-board computers (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi etc.).

If you are using sockets then Extasys is the proper tool for your work. It's been designed to take the hard job done and let you think only about the message exchange (the process).

Developed with <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/"><b>NetBeans IDE</b><a>

#### Goals
* Provide fast and accurate TCP and UDP data transfer
* Asynchronous processing
* Less development time

#### Features
* Dedicated Thread Pool for each TCPServer, TCPClient, UDPServer and UDPClient
* Multiple listeners per server and multiple connectors per Client
* TCP message collector with character or string message splitter


## How to Use

**Fully functional examples on how to use Extasys can be found** [inside the repository](https://github.com/nsiatras/extasys/tree/master/Extasys%20for%20Java%20Examples). In case you want to take a quick look on how to use Extasys then take a look at the following quick examples. _Also read  the [wiki pages](https://github.com/nsiatras/extasys/wiki)_
